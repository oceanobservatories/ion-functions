def replace_fill_with_nan(instrument_fillvalue, *args):
    """
    Description:

        Converts integer data types to float and replaces both system integer fill
        values and instrument integer fill values with nans. The system fill value is
        designated as a global variable in this module, the generic_functions module.
        The instrument fill value(s) are designated as global variables in their
        respective DPA modules and passed into this function via the first calling
        argument in its argument list.

    Usage:

        var1, var2, ... = replace_fill_with_nan(instrument_fillvalue, var1, var2, ...)

            where

        var1, var2, ... = one or more variables. on output, var1 etc are floats
                with system and instrument fill values replaced by nans.
        instrument_fillvalue = if applicable, integer instrument fill value(s):
                if none, use either None, an empty list, or np.array([])
                if one, use either a scalar, a list, or a 1D ndarray
                if more than one, use either a list or a 1D ndarray.
        var1, var2, ... = one or more variables. on input, var1, var2, etc will all be
                np.ndarrays of at least 1 dimension because that is how CI has been
                configured. If float arrays are present in the argument
                list they are passed through unchanged.

    Implemented by:

        2015-06-11: Russell Desiderio. Initial Code.

    Notes:

        The fill value for floats has been designated to be np.nan, but integer data types
        cannot have nan values. Before being supplied as inputs to the DPAs, all integers
        are stored as signed 32 bit integers, so that one system fillvalue could be and is
        assigned. However, instruments can use integer fill values to denote bad or absent
        data in their data streams which are not recognized as such by CI. These instrument
        fill values will in general be different for different instruments.

        Some kinds of integer inputs to DPAs should not be processed with this algorithm. In
        particular the 'beams' variable in vel3dk is used in a dictionary look-up; fill values
        in that variable should not be converted to nans.

    """

    # at least one dimension, many of the unit tests were written before this policy was
    # established. as a result many use core python scalars to represent single-valued

    Description:

        Test arrays a1 and a2 for non-zero values and return the non-zero
        array, preferring a1 if both are present. If needed, multiply the
        returned array by a scale factor so that it will be in the expected
        units.

    Implemented by:

        2019-07-17: Mark Steiner. Initial code.

    Usage:

        out_value = select_non_zero_arg(a1, a2=None, a1_scale_factor=None, a2_scale_factor=None)

            where

        out_value = the scaled array containing at least one non-zero element.
        a1 = an input array to be tested for non-zero elements.
        a2 = an input array to be tested for non-zero elements.
        a1_scale_factor = scale factor to apply to a1
        a2_scale_factor = scale factor to apply to a2

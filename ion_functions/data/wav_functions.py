    FLAG:

        The variable nfreq_dir put out by the WAVSS instrument and therefore
        also the data product WAVSTAT-FDS_L1 can vary within each datapacket
        based solely on measured ocean conditions (with unchanged instrument
        settings). The numbers of values in the L0 data products WAVSTAT_PDS
        and WAVSTAT_SDS for each datapacket are also determined by the nfreq_dir
        values, as is true with the WAVSTAT-DDS_L2 data product (see function
        def wav_triaxys_correct_directional_wave_direction).

        directional wave spectral bins) for the WAVSS instrument class (TRIAXYS
        Wave Sensor, manufactured by AXYS Technologies).

    Implemented by:

        2014-04-03: Russell Desiderio.  Initial code.

            WAVSS $TSPNA (not $TSPMA) data sentence.

            $TSPMA data sentence.

            The maximum sampling period for this instrument is 35 minutes, during which time

            declinaton only one timestamp is required for each ensemble of (x,y) values acquired

    Description:

        The executable code in this function is identical to that in the function
        magnetic_correction_vctrzd in the module adcp_functions. At some point in
        the future the function magnetic_correction in generic_functions may be
        deprecated and replaced with this vectorized and much faster version.

        This function corrects velocity profiles for the magnetic variation
        (declination) at the measurement location.  The magnetic declination
        is obtained from the 2010 World Magnetic Model (WMM2010) provided by
        NOAA (see wmm_declination).

        This version handles 'vectorized' input variables without using for
        loops. It was specifically written to handle the case of a 1D array of
        theta values, theta=f(i), with corresponding sets of 'u' and 'v' values
        such that u=f(i,j) and v=f(i,j), where there are j 'u' and 'v' values
        for each theta(i).

    Implemented by:

        2014-04-04: Russell Desiderio. Initial code. This function is used to
                    calculate magnetic corrections by the functions contained
                    in this module instead of the function magnetic_correction
                    found in ion_functions.data.generic_functions.

    Usage:

        u_cor, v_cor = magnetic_correction(theta, u, v)

            where

        u_cor = eastward velocity profiles, in earth coordinates, with
            the correction for magnetic variation applied.
        v_cor = northward velocity profiles, in earth coordinates,
            with the correction for magnetic variation applied.

        theta = magnetic variation based on location (latitude, longitude and
            altitude) and date; units of theta are [degrees]
        u = uncorrected eastward velocity profiles in earth coordinates
        v = uncorrected northward velocity profiles in earth coordinates

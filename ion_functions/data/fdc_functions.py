    The FDCHP instrument outputs a dataset of 10 Hz data for approximately 20 minutes
        every hour, resulting in around 12000 data records for each dataset.
    The FDCHP data product algorithms parse incoming 1D array data into separate
        datasets and operate on these datasets individually.
    Each of the four L1 products (wind and temperature) consists of 11400 values for
        each 20 minute dataset.
    Each of the three L2 flux products consists of one value per 20 minute dataset.

    Two additional auxiliary data products, not specified in the DPS, have been coded
        to provide time bases for the L1 and L2 products.

    Description:

        Calculates the L1 temperature data product TMPATUR_L1 from the FDCHP
        instrument, which collects 20 minutes of data every hour. The L1 data

        end of each 12000 point dataset.

        The L1 temperature data product is also separately calculated in the
        routine fdc_flux_and_wind which directly calculates the fluxhot product.

    Description:

        Function to remove outliers.
        This function is a weak point in the FDCHP programming.

    Implemented by:

        2014-05-19: Craig Risien. Initial Code
        2014-05-30: Russell Desiderio. Vectorized some of the code.
        2014-11-19: Russell Desiderio. Made code more robust, so that out of range
                    interpolations are returned as nans to avoid execution runtime
                    errors.

    Usage:

        [data] = fdc_despikesimple(data)

            where

        data = (3xN) array of data values

    Notes:

        By default, nearest neighbor interpolation causes a ValueError to be raised
        in instances where extrapolation would be necessary to replace outliers. This
        is trapped out by setting bounds_error to False; then, to match the testcode
        (Matlab) output, a fill value of np.nan (which is also the default) is used.
        This modification also requires the use of nanmedian and nanstd functions,
        else it is possible that the input arrays to interpolate.interp1d be empty.

        A more robust method to find outliers is needed, one that will recognize and
        not include the low frequency trend/variability of the data when specifying data
        points as spikes; some form of a Tukey-style implementation may be appropriate.

        When the data abscissae are equidistant,
            Python Scipy nearest neighbor interpolation replaces from the left.
            Matlab interp1 nearest neighbor interpolation replaces from the right.

               of the array is [n_variables, n_packets, n_pts_per_packet].
        args = argument list (tuple) of input data. The number of elements in the list
                  is n_variables; the first element must be (OOI CI) timestamps. Each
                  element must be a 1D array with the same number of components, which
                  will be on the order of npts * n_packets.

    Notes:

        This routine will also work if the only input variable is a 1D array of timestamps.

        The DPS code was written to process 1 dataset of 12000 records. Therefore, given the
        anticipated form of the L0 data inputs into the DPAs (as 1D arrays not divided up into
        data packets), it was necessary to write this function. It might be beneficial to build
        into it a feature deleting data chunks that are less than some fixed number of records
        as not containing enough data to reliably calculate data product values.

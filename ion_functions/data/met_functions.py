### July 2015
""" use_velptmn_with_metbk """
# Until VELPT current meters are
#     (1) co-located with the METBK instrumentation to measure surface currents and
#     (2) without ferrous interference aliasing the VELPT compass measurements,
# VELPT current measurements should not be used to calculate relative wind speed (with
# respect to water), which is the fundamental windspeed variable used in the METBK
# calculations. Almost all of the METBK L2 data products require the relative wind speed
# as a calling argument.
#
# The DPA to calculate relative wind speed over water is currently set to return actual
# wind speed (as if the current velocities were measured to be 0) for all cases of input
# current velocity values (absent, present, nan).
#
# A subset of the Endurance moorings are the only ones that have VELPT instruments
# mounted to measure surface currents. However, their compass readings are inaccurate due
# to the mounted instruments' proximity to iron ballast in the mooring.
#
# It is anticipated that these moorings will be modified to eliminate this magnetic
# interference. To use the velptmn measurements for METBK calculations on these moorings,
# a 5th variable, use_velptmn_with_metbk, has been added to the argument list of the
# function met_relwind_speed. Implementation of the use_velptmn_with_metbk variable will
# require that it be treated as a "platform/instrument instance specific metadata parameter
# changeable in time". It has been coded to accept time-vectorized input.
#
### Further documentation is contained in the Notes to function met_relwind_speed in this module.

    METBK SENSOR HEIGHTS

    Note that the sensor heights may depend on the type of mooring:
"""
# these 4 sensor height variables were time-vectorized in the July 2015 revision.
#     zwindsp = height of the wind measurement [m]
#     ztmpair = height of air temperature measurement [m]
#     zhumair = height of air humidity measurement [m]
#     ztmpwat = depth of bulk sea surface water measurements [m]

#     zvelptm = depth of surface current measurement [m]:
#         this parameter is specified as metadata in the DPS;
#         however, it is not used in the code.

#     zinvpbl = planetary boundary layer/inversion height: this is
#               set to a default value of 600m in the code, as is
#               used in the DPS. this variable was written to accept
#               time-vectorized input in the initial METBK code.

"""
    Set algorithm switches used in METBK bulk flux calculations
"""
# The jcool and jwarm switches should be set to 1, always!
JCOOLFL = 1      # 1=do coolskin calc
JWARMFL = 1      # 1=do warmlayer calc
#JWAVEFL         # only the windspeed parametrization of the charnok

def met_relwind_speed(vle_wind, vln_wind, vle_water=None, vln_water=None, use_velptmn_with_metbk=0):
    """
    Description:

        Calculates RELWIND_SPD-AUX, the relative windspeed over water, calculated as the
        magnitude of the vector difference of surface current velocity (from VELPT
        measurements) subtracted from wind velocity (from METBK measurements).

        This is the fundamental windspeed variable used in the METBK toga-coare algorithms.

        It is anticipated that the wind measurements will be roughly each minute and that the
        current measurements will be broadcast to that resolution.

    Implemented by:

        2014-08-26: Russell Desiderio. Initial Code.
        2015-07-10: Russell Desiderio. Set default calling water velocity values.
                    Added the switch use_velptmn_with_metbk and code to vet surface current data.

    Usage:

        u_rel = met_relwind_speed(vle_wind, vln_wind[, vle_water, vln_water[, use_velptmn_with_metbk]])

            where

        u_rel = magnitude of windspeed relative to the ocean (RELWIND_SPD-AUX) [m/s]
        vle_wind  = eastward wind speed (WINDAVG-VLE_L1) [m/s]
        vln_wind  = northward wind speed (WINDAVG-VLN_L1) [m/s]
        vle_water = eastward surface current (VELPTMN-VLE_L1) [m/s]
        vln_water = northward surface current (VELPTMN-VLN_L1) [m/s]
        use_velptmn_with_metbk = time-vectorized data quality flag:
                                 0 -> bad  velptmn current data
                                 1 -> good velptmn current data

    Notes:

        Previous fortran and matlab implementations of the toga-coare algorithms (not associated with
        OOI) often used windspeed rather than windspeed relative to water, presumably because surface
        current data were not available. And, the only surface moorings which do have surface current
        meters are 4 Endurance moorings; however, at this time (July 2015) their compass readings are
        aliased because of the proximity of their VELPT current meters to iron mooring ballast.

        Therefore if current data are aliased or missing, met_relwind_speed will set current=0 and use
        the actual windspeed in place of the windspeed relative to water (as the DPS also specifies).
        This is only done in the routine met_relwind_speed, and not in met_relwind_direction,
        met_current_direction, nor met_current_speed. In these latter 3 routines, bad or missing
        current values are set to nan.

        This treatment of current data allows the following two relative wind calculation cases to
        be differentiated. Both cases calculate relative wind using the surface current values
        vle_water=0 and vln_water=0:

            (1) These 0 values came from actual VELPT data. In this case CURRENT_SPD calculated by
                met_current_speed will be 0.
            (2) These 0 values for current were used because the VELPT data were bad or missing. In
                this case CURRENT_SPD calculated by met_current_speed will be a nan.

        Implementation of the use_velptmn_with_metbk variable will require that it be treated as a
        "platform/instrument instance specific metadata parameter changeable in time". It has been
        coded to accept time-vectorized input.

    Derivation:

        This derivation follows that of the Gosnell et al reference cited above. The
        difference is that the wetbulb temperature (assumed to be that of the raindrop)
        is approximated by a Taylor series expansion at the air temperature, as suggested
        by Simon de Szoeke, instead of at the sea temperature, as done in the reference.
        This will be a more accurate calculation of the rain heat flux for normal (rainfall)
        conditions; as Simon pointed out, when Twetbulb < Tair < Tsea, expanding about Tair
        rather than Tsea will give a value closer to the actual wetbulb temperature.

        Equation numbers are from Gosnell et al, cited above. Note that their equations
        (9) and (13) are missing factors of the ratio of the diffusivities.


        The sensible rain heat flux is given by (eqn (5)):

            RHF = cp_rain * R * (Tsea - Train) * rho_rain

                RHF = rain heat flux [W/m^2]
                cp_rain = specific heat of fresh water [J/kg/K]
                R  = rain rate [mm/hr]
                Tsea = bulk sea temperature [degC]
                Train = raindrop temperature, approximated by the wetbulb temperature [degC]
                rho_rain = density of rainwater [kg/m^3] (needed to get RHF in units of W/m^2)

                Units check:

                RHF = J/kg/K * mm/hr * K * kg/m^3 = J/(3600*sec) /(1000*m^2)
                    = W/m^2/3600/1000  (rho_rain=1000, which will cancel)

        To find Train = Twet, use the psychrometric equation (eqn (6)):

            Train = Tair - psi * (qsat_air(Train) - qair)

                Tair = air temperature
                qsat_air = saturation humidity of air as f(temperature)
                qair = ambient specific humidity of air
                psi = (Lv/cp_air)*(dv/dh)
                    Lv = latent heat of vaporization of fresh water at Tair
                    cp_air = specific heat of air
                    dv = water vapor diffusivity
                    dh = heat diffusivity

        Expand qsat_air(Train) as a Taylor series expansion at T = Tair:

            qsat_air(Train) = qsat_air(Tair) + qsat_air'(Tair) * (Train - Tair)

        All terms of the expansion are known; the qsat_air derivative qsat_air'
        is the Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) equation to be evaluated at T=Tair.

        Solve for Train:

            Train = Tair - psi * (qsat_air(Tair) - qair) / (1 + psi * CC(Tair))

        Use this expression for Train in eqn (5) above to calculate RHF.

        THIS CALCULATION OF RAIN HEAT FLUX IS INCORRECT AND NOT USED IN THIS MODULE.

            (1) The original derivation (Gosnell, Fairall, and Webster, JGR(100)(C9)
                18437-18442 1995) dropped a factor of the ratio of the heat and vapor
                diffusivities from eqns (9) and (13). (Verified, personal communication,
                C. Fairall, 2014). This paper's equations were used as they appeared in
                the text when the original coare algorithms were coded so that this error
                has propagated through all versions of the code up to this point.

            (2) The original derivation used a Taylor series expansion at Tsea. Therefore
                the whoi expression for the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is more correct
                than the Edson expression.

            (3) The expansion involves the saturation humidity Qsat of air, the environment
                through which the raindrops are falling, not the saturation humidity of the
                'sea' (of the air directly above the sea surface). Occurrences of the variables
                Qsea and dqer in the original code are incorrect. (If the original derivation
                is to be followed, Qsea should be replaced by Qsat of air at 100% relative
                humidity evaluated at the temperature T=Tsea; dqer would not appear at all).

            (4) The versions of the old code also used the specific heat of seawater instead
                of fresh rain water (almost 5% error).

            (5) The new derivation coded in a separate function follows the suggestion made
                by Simon de Szoeke and features a Taylor series expansion at the air
                temperature instead of at the sea temperature. This is more accurate and
                as an added benefit will avoid the confusion that arose when the sea temperature
                was used as the expansion temperature.

        Incorrectly calculates net upward rain heat flux.

    Notes:

        (1) the jwarm switch selects whether or not the warmlayer code is run.
            the jcool 'switch' is itself a variable within the (original)
            coare35vn code; it was used as a multiplicative factor when
            calculating coolskin corrections, so that when jcool=0, the
            corrections are set to 0.
        (2) for OOI jwarm and jcool are always 1, because all of the OOI
            sea temperature measurements are bulk, not skin, measurements.
        (3) in the more general case, jwarm = jcool always, because:
            (a) jcool = 1 indicates that the input sea temperature values are
                bulk measurements, not surface skin measurements made with
                an infrared thermometer. in this bulk measurement case, both
                coolskin and warmlayer corrections to the bulk temperature are
                required to model the skin temperature (jcool = jwarm = 1).
            (b) jcool = 0 indicates that the input sea temperature values are
                surface skin temperatures directly measured with an infrared
                thermometer, and therefore both the coolskin and warmlayer
                corrections are not to be applied (jcool = jwarm = 0).
        (4) however, both switches are retained for generality in case this
            open source code is appropriated and adapted. (plus, the DPS
            specified archiving the jwarm and jcool switches as metadata).
        (5) the OOI cyberinfrastructure model originally required that each data
            product be specifically calculated by one function. This is the main
            reason that the wrapper function construct is used. In addition, I've
            chosen to explicitly write out its output tuple arguments for each
            data product call, so that the dependence of the various data products
            on these tuple arguments is obvious (underscores are used as placeholders
            for those arguments not used in any particular function call). In
            particular, this construct specifically identifies when coolskin and

    Notes:

        Original code was refactored to produce this version. In-code documentation is a
        mixture of the original code's documentation and my additions.

        Two noteworthy changes made: local time calculation from longitude no longer can give
        negative local times; a mystery addend of 7.5 in the local time calculation, resulting
        in increasing local time by half an hour, was deleted.

        afterwards used to calculate data products. These subroutine names are somewhat
        arbitrary in that there was essentially no documentation in the original code for
        what was being calculated in the loop.

        These key variables are the output of this stripped down version of the original code.
        This python code is not meant to directly calculate data products; rather, it is to
        calculate the key variables from which all associated data products can be calculated.

        This approach greatly increases the number of subroutines required for the calculations.
        However, it also makes explicit which parameters are necessary for the calculation of
        each data product, and in some cases may expose an inconsistent application of either
        the coolskin or warmlayer corrections to the bulk seasurface temperature when these
        data products are calculated.

        sporadically spaced data and for data with time gaps; in the latter
        case, no records are produced for the missing time bins.

        The timestamp for each hour of data is calculated as the midpoint
        of the bin interval. If this is changed to either the beginning or
        end of the interval (the latter may be more appropriate given that
        the warmlayer routine numerically calculates integrals over time)
        then the check values in the unit tests may also need to be changed.

        Note also that the first hourly timestamp will be one half hour after
        the timestamp of the first datum in, so that in the general case the
        hourly timestamps will not correspond to times at the top of the hour
        (ie, the hourly timestamps will not correspond to 6:00, 7:00, 8:00, etc).

        2014-09-18: Russell Desiderio. Initial code.
        2014-10-22: Russell Desiderio. Added capability to process timestamps if
                    it is the only input argument. This was added so that a
                    simple call could be made to this function for the purposes
                    of calculating an hourly timestamp metadata product not
                    included in the DPS but which I anticipate will be needed.
        2015-07-08: Russell Desiderio. Deleted sensor height indices [3, 6, 8, 10]
                    for [ztmpwat, zwindsp, ztmpair, zhumair] from idx_to_skip
                    so that now these parameters on input can either be 1-element 1D
                    arrays or time-vectorized 1D arrays.

    Usage

        args_out = make_hourly_data(*args_in)

            where

        args_out = argument list of hourly data
        args_in = argument list of each minute data


        Timestamps in units of seconds must be the second element in args_in, unless
        it is the only input in the argument list; this was dictated by convenience for
        the ordering of the input arguments into the seasurface_skintemp_correct routine.

        If the number of arguments in is 18, then the inputs are data to be
        prepared for running in the warmlayer and coolskin routines, and so not
        all of the input arguments are to be processed (for example, switches
        and the sensor heights). The variables to be processed is determined by
        a hard-wired list argument index number idx. For any other args_in sized
        input, all inputs are processed.

        All arguments must be 1D arrays of the same length.

    Notes:

        The np.bincount routine is used in much the same way accumarray in matlab
        would be used to construct the hourly data. np.histogram could also have
        been used.

        The key to the routine is to convert the timestamps into elapsed hours
        [0.0, 0.1, 0.7, 1.3, 1.7, 3.1, 3.3] so that when these values are floored
        [ 0 ,  0 ,  0 ,  1 ,  1 ,  3 ,  3 ] the entry at an index represents the
        bin number into which the various variables with that index will belong.

        The summing is carried out by using the weighting feature of the np.bincount
        function, as described in the example in the numpy.bincount documentation at:
        http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.8.1/reference/generated/numpy.bincount.html.

        The same lines of code are executed when calculating the hourly timestamps
        regardless of the number of input arguments, so that if the current method
        is changed only the code at the end of this routine needs to be modified.

    Notes

        Although this routine was written to process hourly data, it will work with
        data on any time base.

        This function provides a measure of quality control for the automated calculation
        of metbk data products. One case: if there are data during one day from 5AM to 10AM,
        then an absence of data so that the next data immediately following are from the
        next day from 11AM to 4PM, the matlab code will treat these data as all coming from
        the same day. Using warmlayer_time_keys will result in the first day's data products
        being calculated as expected and will result in Nans for the second day's data as
        desired.

        The original fortran and matlab versions of the warmlayer function hard-coded
        a 6 AM threshold (equatorial sunrise). The OOI routines coded here construct
        hourly averages from each-minute data and assign a timestamp at the midpoint of
        the binning interval. So, if a day's first each-minute data record timestamp is
        at 5:45 AM local, then the the first hourly timestamp will be 6:15 AM, in which
        case the warmlayer routine would not be run on that day's data.

        The threshold is set here at 6:00 AM local just as it is in the original code. The
        rationale is that the first day's data should start before sunrise at the beginning
        of the daily heating cycle. At some point it may be desirable to replace this value
        with one calculated as a function of time of year, latitude, and perhaps longitude.

        If the timestamp assigned to the hourly intervals is changed to either the first or
        last time of the binning interval, it may be desirable to also change the warmlayer
        threshold value.
